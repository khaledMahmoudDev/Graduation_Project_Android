A problem statement is a short, succinct explanation of a problem a business is facing and a proposed solution to the problem.
 Problem statements can be effective ways to define an issue and communicate a solution within a short span of time.
 Before you write your problem statement, think about the problem and your proposed solution,
 and be prepared to back it up with facts!
